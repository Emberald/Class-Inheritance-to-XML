# Class-Inheritance-to-XML
This PHP script scans through a local Java project and generates several XML templates for [Prefuse](http://prefuse.org/) visualization, as well as a readable record of the structure of classes inheritance. 
###How to use
```
php main.php /path/to/target/project
```
By doing so a folder called 'output' will be created under the same directory of main.php to place all outputs.
